## BurgerBot

Slightly extended version of https://github.com/sonac/burgerbot, polls for burgeramt appointments in berlin and sends a telegram message when they appear.

First run `make init` and update `.env` with your telegram api key, then

... to run in a docker container run `make run-docker`

... to run locally run `make run-dev` (requires [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/))
